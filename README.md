# Friend-Finder

# Overview
This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display via modal the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The survey has 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
